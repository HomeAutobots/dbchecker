## 🛠️ Usage

### Running Tests with Coverage

#### Option 1: Enhanced Test Runner
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
python test/run_tests.py

# Run only unit tests with coverage
python test/run_tests.py unit

# Run only functional tests with coverage
python test/run_tests.py functional

# Run without coverage analysis
python test/run_tests.py --no-coverage

# Set custom thresholds
python test/run_tests.py --coverage-threshold 80.0 --success-threshold 90.0
```

#### Option 2: Pytest Runner
```bash
# Run all tests with pytest

python run_pytest.py unit

# Run functional tests only
python run_pytest.py functional

# Run quietly
python run_pytest.py -q
```

#### Option 3: Direct Pytest
```bash
# Run tests with coverage using pytest directly
python -m pytest test/unit -v --cov=dbchecker --cov-report=html:test_reports/coverage_html --cov-report=term
```

    name: coverage-reports
    path: test_reports/
    
- name: Comment Coverage Results
  run: |
    python view_reports.py show --latest
```

### Coverage Badges
The XML coverage report can be used with services like:
- Codecov
- Coveralls
- CodeClimate

## 📋 Best Practices

### Running Tests
1. **Always run with coverage** for complete analysis
2. **Use appropriate test types** (unit vs functional) based on changes
3. **Review coverage reports** to identify untested code
4. **Set appropriate thresholds** for your project requirements

### Report Management
1. **Archive old reports** to prevent disk space issues
2. **Compare reports regularly** to track progress
3. **Address failing tests** before coverage analysis
4. **Use HTML reports** for detailed coverage investigation

### Development Workflow
1. Run tests locally before committing
2. Use coverage reports to guide test writing
3. Aim for >80% coverage on new code
4. Review test failures in detail using the report viewer
